#### How to install the modpack
{{< expand "How to install the modpack" >}}
{{< alert theme="warning" >}}
_**I recommend you read the KeyBinds page before you start playing on the server.**_
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert theme="success" >}}
The server has been added to the modpack's server list. The server is however whitelisted. Make sure you have access to the server before you download the modpack. 
{{< /alert >}}

Once you have downloaded MultiMC from the requirements above, you can install the modpack by following these steps:

Press `Add Instance`

#### Keybindings
Some keybindings are different from the default settings. This is to make the keybindings work properly. You are free to change them to your liking.

#### VoiceChat mod
The server has a VoiceChat mod! However the settings might not be perfectly set for your system. I recommend you to check the settings and change them to your liking. The keybind for the VoiceChat mod is `V`.

#### Web map
We have a web map for the server! You can access it by going to [http://nevadaskies.net:8123](https://nevadaskies.net:8123). The website only works when the server is running. So if it is down, it means the server is down.

#### Mods in the modpack
{{< expand "Mods in the modpack" >}}

{{< alert theme="info" >}}
The FirstPersonModel mod is a mod that allows you to see your character in first person. This is a great mod for people who want to see their character in first person. However for those that do not wish to see their character in first person, you can disable it in the mod settings. A description on how will be at the bottom of the post.
