#### How to install the modpack
{{< expand "How to install the modpack" >}}
{{< alert theme="warning" >}}

{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert theme="success" >}}
The server has been added to the modpack's server list. The server is however whitelisted. Make sure you have access to the server before you download the modpack. 
{{< /alert >}}

#### Keybindings
Some keybindings are different from the default settings. This is to make the keybindings work properly. You are free to change them to your liking.

#### VoiceChat mod
The server has a VoiceChat mod! However the settings might not be perfectly set for your system. I recommend you to check the settings and change them to your liking. The keybind for the VoiceChat mod is `V`.

#### Web map
We have a web map for the server! You can access it by going to [http://nevadaskies.net:8123](http://nevadaskies.net:8123). The website only works when the server is running. So if it is down, it means the server is down.
