This season will be all about the Magic and the journey of adventure!

#### How to install the modpack
{{< expand "How to install the modpack" >}}
{{< alert theme="warning" >}}
_**I recommend you to check the KeyBindings before you start playing on the server.**_
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert theme="success" >}}
The server has been added to the modpack's server list. The server is however whitelisted. Make sure you have access to the server before you download the modpack. 
{{< /alert >}}

Double click the file in your downloads folder

#### Keybindings
Some keybindings might be different from the default settings. This is to make the keybindings work properly. You are free to change them to your liking.

#### VoiceChat mod
The server has a VoiceChat mod! However the settings might not be perfectly set for your system. I recommend you to check the settings and change them to your liking. The keybind for the VoiceChat mod is `V`.


#### What's new and cool?

##### For modded maps we are now using **Antique Atlas 4!**

##### Legendary Origins!
{{< alert theme="warning" >}}
_**Take the time in single player before you join the multiplayer for this one. You won't be able to change later!**_
{{< /alert >}}

Legendary Origins comes with: 5 Races, 8 Classes and 4 Professions in over 100 different combinations! Including New Recipes and game mechanics.

##### Distant Horizons & Shaders!
{{< alert theme="warning" >}}
_**Shaders could cause lag on somewhat high end machines. I recommend turning them off if it becomes an issue.**_
{{< /alert >}}

Explore the new world in new amazing ways!
